# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: C++17 (required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Eclipse Paho MQTT C++ (paho-mqtt-cpp), Google Test (gtest)
**Storage**: JSON configuration files, in-memory message buffers
**Testing**: Google Test for unit and integration testing (constitution requirement)
**Target Platform**: Linux (primary), macOS (secondary), Windows (if time permits)
**Project Type**: single C++ application with CLI interface
**Performance Goals**: Handle 100+ messages/second, sub-second reconnection
**Constraints**: No dynamic allocation during message processing, 80%+ test coverage required
**Scale/Scope**: Proof of concept - single device simulation, basic telemetry

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **C++17 Standards**: All code compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` without warnings
- [ ] **MQTT Library**: Only Eclipse Paho MQTT C++ library used for MQTT operations
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 80%+ test coverage with Google Test framework
- [ ] **Connection Resilience**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff implemented
- [ ] **Simplicity**: No unnecessary abstractions, minimal dependencies beyond Paho and GTest
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Smart pointers used, no raw pointer ownership
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Clear separation between exceptions (programming errors) and error codes (recoverable failures)

```

**Structure Decision**: C++ single project structure selected for proof of concept simplicity. Modular design with separate directories for MQTT handling, ThingsBoard protocol, configuration management, and utilities. CMake-based build system for cross-platform compilation. Clear separation between source code (`src/`), headers (`include/`), and tests (`tests/`) following C++ best practices.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
